I am a researcher at the [VATT Institute for Economic Research](https://vatt.fi/en/frontpage) and a PhD Candidate at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-economics). My research interests are mainly in the fields of environmental and public economics. Currently, I am studying the effectiveness and distributional impacts of policies aimed at reducing emissions in the transportation sector.
